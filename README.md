# Agent
Creating AI agents involves designing systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform actions to achieve specific goals. The process typically includes:

Define the agent's goal

Design the environment

Select the type of agent (Reactive, Deliberative, Learning, Hybrid)

Implement perception (sensors, data input, etc.)

Build decision-making logic (rules, planning, ML, or RL)

Enable action execution

Train and test the agent

Deploy and monitor performance
